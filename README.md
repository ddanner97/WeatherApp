This minimalist weather app allows users to easily search locations and check the current weather and forecast for that area.

## Project Description

This project is a front-end application built using **React.js** and **scss** while leveraging OpenWeatherMap's free api's for current weather as well the 5 day forecast. My main goal with this project was to increase my understanding of React's main concepts using class components while practicing retrieving data from an external API.
